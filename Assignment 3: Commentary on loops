When we start learning how to code we would obviously encounter the master of the infinity and void, LOOPS!
It is the most essential concept/tool that allows a computer to perform repetitive tasks without part where you copy and paste multiple lines of code to run each and every single one over and over again.
The different loops are very confusing at first, but by learning each of them one by one, their uniqueness and differences become clear.
The most basic loop that we usualy learn first is the while loop.
Its structure is very straightforward and it consists of the ketword while followed by a condition
